I am a Ph.D. candidate in Applied Sciences in Engineering at the Technical University of Liberec, working at the intersection of statistical methods, machine learning, and subsurface hydrogeology. My research focuses on accelerating uncertainty quantification (UQ) for groundwater flow and contaminant transport models.

In my dissertation, I focus on Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) methods for 3D discrete fracture-matrix (DFM) models to enable efficient simulation of groundwater processes in heterogeneous fractured media. 
The application of MLMC to DFM models is, by itself, a novel contribution that advances uncertainty quantification for fractured porous media. Furthermore, I introduce a convolutional-neural-network–based surrogate for numerical homogenization of hydraulic conductivity tensors, which substantially reduces the computational cost of MLMC and makes large-scale realistic simulations computationally feasible.

Beyond my core Ph.D. research, I develop generative AI models (VQGAN and diffusion models) for synthesizing realistic 3D pelvic CT scans to support medical research and data augmentation in healthcare. I also work on data assimilation for the Richards equation using the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) with both laboratory and field soil-moisture measurements to improve predictive capabilities in unsaturated flow modeling.


My broader research interests include:
• Scientific Machine Learning (SciML)
• Multilevel Monte Carlo methods & Uncertainty Quantification
• Generative AI for Scientific and Medical Applications
• Data Assimilation & Kalman Filtering
