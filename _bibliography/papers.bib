abstract={This paper presents a meta-modeling-based
technique to reduce the computational cost of Monte Carlo
methods. A stochastic simulation of groundwater flow
is substituted with a graph neural network meta-model.
This type of neural network can deal with a non-euclidean
structure of the input data, which in our case is a graph
representing a random field on an unstructured mesh. In
order to find the most suitable meta-model, a comparison
of the standard support vector regression with spectral and
spatial graph convolutional neural networks is provided.
Both the Monte Carlo method and the multilevel Monte
Carlo method are extended by the meta-model level. In
both cases, up to 50% savings in computational cost are
achieved while maintaining the accuracy of Monte Carlo
estimates.},

ABSTRACT = {Groundwater contaminant transport modeling is a vitally important topic. Since modeled processes include uncertainties, Monte Carlo methods are adopted to obtain some statistics. However, accurate models have a substantial computational cost. This drawback can be overcome by employing the multilevel Monte Carlo method (MLMC) or approximating the original model using a meta-model. We combined both of these approaches. A stochastic model is substituted with a deep learning meta-model that consists of a graph convolutional neural network and a feed-forward neural network. This meta-model can approximate models solved on unstructured meshes. The meta-model within the standard Monte Carlo method can bring significant computational cost savings. Nevertheless, the meta-model must be highly accurate to obtain similar errors as when using the original model. Proposed MLMC with the new lowest-accurate level of meta-models can reduce total computational costs, and the accuracy of the meta-model does not have to be so high. The size of the computational cost savings depends on the cost distribution across MLMC levels. Our approach is especially efficacious when the dominant computational cost is on the lowest-accuracy MLMC level. Depending on the number of estimated moments, we can reduce computational costs by up to ca. 25% while maintaining the accuracy of estimates.},

  abstract={Modeling groundwater flow in three-dimensional fractured crystalline media requires capturing the spatial heterogeneity introduced by fractures. Direct numerical simulations using fine-scale discrete fracture-matrix (DFM) models are computationally demanding, particularly when repeated evaluations are needed. 
We aim to use a multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) method in the future to reduce computational cost while retaining accuracy. When transitioning between accuracy levels, numerical homogenization is used to upscale the impact of the hydraulic conductivity of sub-resolution fractures.
To reduce the computational cost of conventional 3D numerical homogenization, we develop a surrogate model that predicts the equivalent hydraulic conductivity tensor $\tn K^{eq}$ from a voxelized 3D domain representing a tensor-valued random field of matrix and fracture hydraulic conductivities. Fracture properties, including size, orientation, and aperture, are sampled from distributions informed by natural observations.
The surrogate architecture combines a 3D convolutional neural network with feed-forward layers to capture both local spatial patterns and global interactions. Three surrogates are trained on data generated by discrete fracture-matrix (DFM) simulations, each corresponding to a different fracture-to-matrix conductivity ratio. Their performance is evaluated across varying fracture network parameters and correlation lengths of the matrix field.
The trained surrogates achieve high prediction accuracy ($\text{NRMSE} < 0.22$) in a wide range of test scenarios. To demonstrate practical applicability, we compare conductivities upscaled by numerical homogenization and by our surrogates in two macro-scale problems: computation of equivalent tensors of hydraulic conductivity and prediction of outflow from a constrained 3D area.
In both cases, the surrogate-based approach preserves accuracy while substantially reducing computational cost.
Surrogate-based upscaling achieves speedups exceeding $100\times$ when inference is performed on a GPU.},

  abstract={Simulating water flow in fractured crystalline rock requires tackling its stochastic nature. We aim to utilize the multilevel Monte Carlo method for cost-effective estimation of simulation statistics. This multiscale approach entails upscaling of fracture hydraulic conductivity by homogenization. In this work, we replace 2D numerical homogenization based on the discrete fracture-matrix (DFM) approach with a surrogate model to expedite computations. We employ a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) connected to a deep feed-forward neural network as the surrogate. The equivalent hydraulic conductivity tensor K^eq is predicted based on the input tensorial spatial random fields (SRFs) of hydraulic conductivities, along with the cross-section and hydraulic conductivity of fractures. Three independent surrogates with the same architecture are trained, each with a different ratio of fracture-to-matrix hydraulic conductivity K_f/K_m. As the ratio K_f/K_m increases, the distribution of K^eq becomes more complex, leading to a decline in the prediction accuracy of the surrogates. The prediction accuracy improves as the fracture density decreases, regardless of the K_f/K_m. We also investigate prediction accuracy for different correlation lengths of input SRFs. The observed speedup gained by surrogates varies from 4x to 24x depending on the number of homogenization blocks. Upscaling by numerical homogenization and surrogate modeling is compared on two macroscale problems. For the first one, the accuracy of outcomes is directly correlated with the accuracy of K^eq predictions. For the latter one, we observe only a mild impact of the upscaling method on the accuracy of the results.},
